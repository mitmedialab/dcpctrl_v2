slxMDCPFcnDemo

This body of code demonstrates how functions from DCPCtrl_V1 can be used
with Simulink/in DCPCtrl_V2. This code works as follows:

1) Raw trajectory is generated with sampleDatsetGen.m
2) Trajectory can be converted to joint-space offline with sampleDatsetRun.m
3) Trajectory can be converted to joint-space in Desktop Real-Time by
running slxMDCPFcnDemo.slx.
