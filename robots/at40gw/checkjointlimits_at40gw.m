This function checks a vector of joint position values for the AT40GW to
verify that no joint position limits have been violated.

INPUTS:
  qraw - Nx4 

OUTPUTS:
  exceeded - Nx4 boolean matrix indicating which movement and which
      joints have exceeded values
  condensed - Nx1 boolean vector indicating which movements have any
      exceeded values
  lt - Nx4 boolean vector indicating which joints are below a min
  gt - Nx4 boolean vector indicating which joint are above a max

%}

poslims = [robot.Joint.PosLim];
jmax = [poslims.Max];
jmin = [poslims.Min];

% Hack because J2 is backwards
[jmax(2), jmin(2)] = deal(jmin(2), jmax(2));

ltl = bsxfun(@lt, qraw, jmin);
gtl = bsxfun(@gt, qraw, jmax);

exceeded = ltl | gtl;
condensed = any(exceeded, 2);
